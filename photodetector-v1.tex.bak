\begin{abstract}

The chemical modification of the surface of MoS$_2$ serves to alter the electrical properties of the material significantly. Here, we report the two-fold enhancement of the photoresponsivity of monolayer MoS$_2$ FETs by rapid treatment with O$_2$:Ar (1:3) plasma. We characterise the surface of plasma-exposed MoS$_2$ by TEM, AFM, Raman and PL mapping and uncover the role of MoO$_x$ in improving the photocurrent generation in our devices. Both photoresponsivity and field effect mobility are enhanced under illumination wavelengths of 488 nm and 632 nm, for a range of laser powers. The results highlight the beneficial effect of plasma-treatment as a fast and convenient way of modifying and improving the properties of 2D MoS$_2$ devices for future consideration in optoelectronics research.

\lettrine[lines=3]{T}wo-dimensional materials have attracted wide research interest due to their interesting properties and potential applications. In addition to graphene, the family of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is the most studied group of 2D materials. The bandgap of TMDs ranges from about 1.1 to 2.1 eV, \cite{wang2012electronics} which makes them good candidates for various devices, including photodetectors, \cite{Li2015, Miao2015, Qiu2014} field effect transistors (FETs), \cite{Radisavljevic2013} and logic devices.\cite{huang2013large} Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) is a typical layered TMD. The MoS$_2$ crystal is an indirect gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.8 eV in the bulk,\cite{Mak2010a} and a direct gap of 1.2 eV in the monolayer limit (ref 8,9). This allows monolayer MoS$_2$ FETs to achieve high ON/OFF current ratios ranging between 10$^7$-10$^9$. \cite{qiu2012electrical} 
Due to this, optoelectronic devices fabricated from MoS$_2$ have received notable attention in recent years. \cite{Yoo2017, Lopez-Sanchez2013, Wang2015, Chen2015} MoS$_2$ phototransistors are easier and cheaper to manufacture than Si-based photodiodes,\cite{Lopez-Sanchez2013} they respond to a wide range of excitation wavelengths,\cite{Lopez-Sanchez2013, Wang2015} and their photoresponsivity can be tuned by various methods. These include back-gating,\cite{Yin2012} encapsulation in HfO$_2$ \cite{Kufer2015} and evaporation of MoO$_x$ overlayer.\cite{Yoo2017}\\
\indent In this work, we demonstrate the enhancement of photoresponsivity of CVD monolayer MoS$_2$ phototransistors by rapid treatment with O$_2$:Ar (1:3) plasma. The photoresponsivity is improved two-fold after only 2 seconds of exposure to the plasma. At the same time, the field effect mobility of the monolayer FET under illumination improves by over one order of magnitude. We find that the improvement of electrical performance is due to the surface presence of MoO$_x$ resulting from chemical conversion of MoS$_2$ by the oxygen-containing plasma. This methodology a fast and convenient way to tune the optoelectronic performance of on-chip CVD-grown MoS$_2$. \newline
\indent Monolayer MoS$_2$ CONOR CVD PARAGRAPH. The flakes were identified by optical microscope and were further characterized using AFM (Oxford Asylum)
and Raman spectroscopy to confirm the number of
layers. Electrodes were fabricated by standard electron beam
lithography, using PMMA 350K photoresist, baked
at 180$^{\circ}$C for 3 minutes after spin coating, and then exposed at a dose of 130 $\mu$C/$\mu$m$^2$ with a 20 keV beam. Development of samples was done methyl isobutyl ketone:isopropyl
alchohol (MIBK:IPA) 1:3 solution for 60 s, followed by an
IPA rinse for 25 s and drying using a N$_2$ gun. Ti(10 nm)/Au(40 nm) contacts were deposited
using an e-beam evaporation tool (Temescal) followed by lift-off in acetone for 8 hours at room temperature. Plasma
treatment was carried out in a Fischione Instruments 1020 plasma cleaner for 2 seconds, utilising O$_2$:Ar (1:3) gas, at a chamber base pressure of $\sim 5 mbar$. The electrical characterization was performed in a two-probe configuration on a micromanipulator probe station (Imina miBot) using a source meter unit (Agilent
B2912A) in the ambient. The devices were back-gated through the heavily p-doped Si substrate. The wavelengths of the lasers used for FET irradiation were 488 nm and 632 nm. For each wavelength, the
power density was tuned at five different levels and pre-measured to ensure no power fluctuation before experiment. The laser was directed through a condenser lens (20 $\times$, NA = 0.4) and the spot size was 1.5 $\mu$m and 1.9 $\mu$m for 488 nm and
632 nm respectively.
Transmission electron microscopy was carried out in an FEI Titan 80-300 operated at 300 kV, at a chamber
pressure of $4 \cdot 10^{-7}$ mbar. Atomic force microscopy was performed at ambient pressure in an Oxford Asylum system using cantilevers calibrated at 140 kHz. PL AND RAMAN FROM CONORS SYSTEM \newline
\indent Our monolayer CVD MoS$_2$ device performs as a standard
n-type FET with a field effect mobility of 0.13 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ under no illumination. We collected the output and transfer characteristics of the device under two different wavelength (488 nm $\&$ 632 nm), at 5 different powers for each. The device channel was 3 $\mu$m, hence the laser spot avoided the Au electrodes during illumination and all of the collected photo-generated current originated in the MoS$_2$.\\

\indent Figure 1 shows the output and transfer characteristics of the device at different wavelengths before and after plasma treatment. Comparing Fig. 1a)
and 1c), it can be seen that the drain-source current increases two-fold for illuminated samples after 2 seconds of plasma exposure at the highest incident power. Figs. 1b) and 1d) show the transfer curves for the same sample, before and after plasma treatment. Thethreshold voltage of the untreated device is shifted drastically to the negative gate biases once higher power illumination occurs. The associated inability to turn off the carrier-rich FET channel at standard gate biases is evident from the plots, where the output current stays firmly above 10$^{-7}$ A even at V$_{GS}$ =  - 60 V. After plasma treatment, the level of output current in the threshold region drops by close to 1 order of magnitude and the threshold is seen to shift to more positive gate biases indicating hole doping in the material (ref). In addition, at low laser powers it can be seen that the MoS$_2$ now possesses a weak ambipolar response past the gate threshold, indicating hole conduction caused by the likely presence of plasma-created oxides. However, the output current in the saturation region of the gate curve has now improved by one order of magnitude under all illumination powers. The dark gated current is decreased slightly, indicating the necessity of illumination for performance improvement after plasma treatment.\\
\indent Figs. 2a) and 2c), track the extracted MoS$_2$ field effect mobility ($\mu_{fe}$) before and after chemical reaction with the plasma at 488 nm and 632 nm respectively. Even with no laser illumination, the mobility is seen to improve in the plasma-treated samples by just under 1 order of magnitude. When the device is exposed to plasma, the mobility of the carriers increases 10-fold with rising laser power. Similarly, in Figs. 2b) and 2d), the output current for the respective wavelength illuminations is seen to improve slightly once plasma treatment takes place. The photoresponsivity and mobility enhancements are summarised for the two wavelengths in Table 1.\\

\indent We employ an energy band diagram to illustrate the physical process responsible for the reported photoresponsivity improvement.
Electron affinity and band gap of monolayer MoS$_2$
is about 4.3 eV and 1.2 eV respectively.\cite{Liang2013,Mak2010a} After the rapid plasma treatment, MoO$_x$ is generated in the device as demonstrated in the previous discussion. MoO$_x$ is commonly known as a high work function (6.8 eV) material with a band gap of 3 eV.\cite{Kang2014, Yoo2017} In the presently studied device, plasma-generated oxides and unreacted MoS$_2$ will form an effective medium that spans the FET channel. As the Fermi
level of MoS$_2$ is higher than that of MoO$_x$, significant band bending will occur at the interface as seen in Fig. 4. After reaching equilibrium, the built-in electric field gradient will be directed from MoS$_2$ to MoO$_x$. Photo-generated holes will become trapped at the material interface inhibiting electron-hole recombination, and thereby enhancing the measured
photocurrent. Hence, the responsivity of the device to laser irradiation is improved, as any photo-generated electrons in the plasma-treated system are free to move in the channel without direct recombination with holes. \newline
\indent In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the photoresponsivity of MoS$_2$ monolayer FETs can be enhanced two-fold by the introduction of surface-bound molybdenum oxides. We confirm the presence of MoO$_x$ induced by plasma treatment using TEM, AFM, Raman and PL spectroscopy. The effect of the mobility enhancement and photoresponsivity was also noted to depend on laser power and be more prominent at powers exceeding several $\mu$Watts. Our work can provide insight into heterostructure physics in novel nano-devices in the areas of optoelectronics and 2D layered materials.
